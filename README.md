📊 Manager Feedback Dashboard

This project was developed during my Summer 2024 internship as a Tech Intern. As a first-year student, I had the opportunity to explore the fields of data science and analytics, working on real organizational data to generate insights on managerial performance.

🔍 Project Overview

The Manager Feedback Dashboard was designed to analyze survey data collected from employees regarding their managers. The dataset was anonymized for confidentiality (manager names were replaced with celebrity names).

My role involved:
-Collecting and merging multiple Excel files containing feedback responses.
-Cleaning and formatting raw survey data.
-Performing qualitative, quantitative, and behavioral-style analysis of responses.
-Creating visualizations to map different managerial traits and highlight patterns.
-Building an interactive dashboard to provide data-driven insights for leadership review.

🛠 Tools & Skills Learned
-Power BI → Dashboard creation, interactive filters, visual storytelling
-Excel / Google Sheets → Data cleaning, transformations, formatting
-Data Analysis Techniques → Quantitative scoring, qualitative categorization, behavioral style mapping
-Visualization Types: Bell curves, heatmaps, comparative bar charts, score distributions

(Note: Original company data cannot be shared due to confidentiality.)

📈 Key Analysis

The dashboard provided multiple insights:
📌 Identified high-performing managers with consistently strong feedback.
📌 Highlighted red-flag cases where managers scored low in communication or leadership.
📌 Mapped behavioral styles of managers using survey responses.
📌 Segregated results into quantitative vs qualitative dimensions.
📌 Tracked overall distribution of scores via bell curves and heatmaps.

🚀 Features of the Dashboard
✅ Interactive filters (by manager, department, or survey category)
✅ Quantitative and qualitative insights side by side
✅ Bell curve & heatmap visualizations for deeper score analysis
✅ Scorecards highlighting top and low-performing managers
✅ Clear action points for HR and leadership review


📝 Learnings from Internship
-This project gave me hands-on experience in:
-Working with real-world survey data.
-Applying data cleaning, formatting, and transformation techniques.
-Understanding how different types of analysis (quantitative, qualitative, behavioral) contribute to organizational insights.
-Creating dashboards that reflect not only numbers but also stories and red flags for decision-making.
-Learning advanced features of Power BI (heatmaps, bell curves, custom visuals).

✨ This project was an important step in my journey into data analytics and helped me bridge classroom learning with practical problem-solving during my first-year internship.
